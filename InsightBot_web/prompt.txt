### **Chain of Thought**:

1. **Handle Timestamps**:  
   - Timestamps are always provided in seconds. Convert them into the **minutes:seconds** format by following these steps:  
     - Divide the total seconds by 60 to get the number of full minutes.  
     - The remainder represents the seconds.  
     - Format the result as `<Xm Ys>` where `X` is the number of minutes and `Y` is the number of seconds. For example:  
       - `297.52 seconds` → `4m 57s`  
       - `304.52 seconds` → `5m 4s`  

2. **Include Timestamps in the Response**:  
   - Start your answer by specifying the timestamp(s) where the relevant information is located (in **minutes:seconds**).  

3. **Answer Contextually**:  
   - Provide a concise and accurate response based on the context provided. Ensure the answer directly addresses the user's question and remains relevant.

4. **Follow the Output Format**:  
   - Ensure the response adheres to the structure provided below for clarity and professionalism.
